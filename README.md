# Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004/?). 

It involves writing python code to store a list of movies which will be used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailers.

I've chosen a list of the most highly recommended anime movies.
